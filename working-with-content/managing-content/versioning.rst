Versioning
===============

An overview on how to view the version history of an item, compare versions, preview previous versions and revert to previous versions.

Creating a new version
--------------------------

Castle includes a versioning feature.
By default, the following content types have versioning enabled:

-  Pages
-  News Items
-  Events
-  Links

Note that all other content types do track workflow history (so, when an item was published, unpublished etcetera)

Content items can be configured to have versioning enabled/disabled through the Site Setup Castle Configuration panel under "Types".

When editing an item, you may use the **change note** field at the bottom; the change note will be stored in the item's version history.
If the change note is left blank, Castle includes a default note: "Initial Revision".

A new version is created every time the item is saved.
Versioning keeps track of all kinds of edits: content, metadata, settings, etc.

Viewing the version history
---------------------------

Once an item has been saved, you can see the **History** of an item by clicking on the *History* item in the Toolbar.

The most recent version is listed first. The History view provides the following information:

-  The type of edit (content or workflow)
-  Which user made the edit
-  What date and time the edit occurred


Comparing versions
------------------

From the History viewlet you can compare any previous version with the current version or any other version with the version just before it.

To compare any previous version with the one just before it, click the *Compare* link located between two adjacent versions in the History overlay.


By clicking this button, you'll see a screen like this one where you can see the differences between the two versions:

You may also compare any previous version to the *current* version by clicking the *Compare to current* link.


Viewing and reverting to previous versions
------------------------------------------

**You can preview any previous version** of a document by clicking the *View* link to the right of any version listed.

**To revert back to a previous version**, click on the *Revert to this revision* button to the right of any version listed.
