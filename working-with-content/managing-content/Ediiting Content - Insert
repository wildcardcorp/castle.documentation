Editing Content - Insert
========================

Editing content in Castle is a simple process because everything is done with tiles.

To edit content you can either find the content by clicking on **Manage Content** from the left hand menu and selecting the *Edit* icon from the actions menu

 or if you are already working with the content you want to edit just click **Edit** from the right hand menu which will bring up the content ready to be edited.

The default content will show tiles for **Title**, **Description**, and **Text**.

If you want to add an addtional tile such as an image click the **Layout** button on the top left of the page and choose the **Customize** option.

Click on the type of tile you want to add and you will see a popup menu specific to that type of tile.  Fill in all of the required fields which are marked with a red dot and click the *Save* button.  You will be returned to your page and have a tile which can be placed where ever you want it to appear on the page.  When you have the tile in the desired positiion click once and the tile will be placed there.  

You may click on any tile at a later time if you decided you need to edit it or delete it all together.  When you click on a tile you will see two buttons on the bottom right corner.  One is *Edit* the other is *Delete*.  Clicking on the Edit button will bring you back to the Edit popup menu and you can make any changes you desire.  When you are finished click the *Save* button.

The *Delete* button will remove the tile completely from the page.  When you click *Delete* you will be asked to confirm your delete.  Click *Confirm Delete* to remove the tile and *Cancel* to leave it as it is.
