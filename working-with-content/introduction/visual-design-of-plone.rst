Visual Design of Castle Web Sites
=====================================

Castle allows web site administrators and designers the ability to create unique site designs.
Here's an overview of the Castle layout, and some design examples.

What does a Castle web site look like?
The default design looks generally like this:

.. figure:: /_static/Plone-default-design-areas.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Plone default design areas

The Castle web site you use could have a design radically different from this, but you should be able to find common elements, such as the log in link and a navigation panel or menu.
In the default design, the navigation menu is in the left area, and usually appears as an indented list of folders in the site.
There also may be a set of tabs in the *Log In, Location Information* strip near the top.

We can distinguish between the *design* of a web site and the *functionality* of a web site.
Quite often, these aspects of a website are also under the control of different people with different skillsets.
A designer will think about the layout, the appearance and the user interface, while a content editor will think about the structure of the information.

All of these aspects can be strictly separated in Castle, and can be adjusted independent from each other.


We'll use the default Castle layout design as an example of typical divisions of the screen:

.. figure:: /_static/plonedefaultareaslabeled.png
   :align: center
   :alt:

You may need to adapt these terms as needed for your Castle web site design.
You may encounter varied terms for describing screen real estate, such as right and left "slots," for the left and right column areas, "portlet," or "viewlet," for discrete areas or boxes, and several other terms.

.. For example, we can look at a web site from the `list of Castle success stories <https://Castle.com/success-stories>`_ to compare:

.. figure:: /_static/victoria.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Victoria state emergency website

This is the Emergency Service web site for the Australian state of Victoria, giving citizens the latest update on potential natural disasters.
The header section has the main navigation tabs, and a login for members.
The left area lists the latest news.
The main area has one large image and four columns of smaller images, serving as links to important areas of the website.
At the bottom area (often known as "footer") it has links to social media, legal information and contact information.

Nowadays, since the rise of mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, websites quite often look different depending on the screen size.
On a smartphone, the navigation is often contracted into a single icon that expands when the user touches it.
Also, the "left" and "right" areas may be shown after the "main" area when using a smartphone.
This technique is known as *responsive design*, and can be easily implemented using Castle.
The default theme for Castle uses this method already.

So, what does a Castle web site look like?
Traditionally, the out-of-the-box look is like that shown at the top of this page, with
header, menu, columns, and a footer.
But using the flexible "Diazo" theme engine of Castle, each aspect can be made to look any way the designer chooses, and can also be shown different depending on the device of the visitor.
