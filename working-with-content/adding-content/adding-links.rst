Adding Links 
============


In addition to links embedding within pages, Links can be created as discrete content items.
Having links as discrete items lets you do things like organizing them in folders, setting keywords on them to facilitate grouping in lists and search results, or include them in navigation.

Add a link by clicking the menu choice in the **Add...** menu:

.. image:: Add.png

.. .. code:: robotframework
      :class: hidden

   *** Test Cases ***

   Show add new link menu
       Go to  ${PLONE_URL}

       Wait until element is visible
       ...  css=span.icon-plone-contentmenu-factories
       Click element  css=span.icon-plone-contentmenu-factories

       Wait until element is visible
       ...  css=#plone-contentmenu-factories li.plone-toolbar-submenu-header

       Mouse over  link
       Update element style  portal-footer  display  none

       Capture and crop page screenshot
       ...  ${CURDIR}/../../_robot/adding-links_add-menu.png
       ...  css=div.plone-toolbar-container
       ...  css=#plone-contentmenu-factories ul

.. .. figure:: ../../_robot/adding-links_add-menu.png
      :align: center
      :alt: add-new-menu.png

You will see the Add*Link* panel:

.. image:: AddLink.png

.. .. code:: robotframework
      :class: hidden

   *** Test Cases ***

   Show new link add form
       Page should contain element  link
       Click link  link

       Wait until element is visible
       ...  css=#form-widgets-IDublinCore-title

       Capture and crop page screenshot
       ...  ${CURDIR}/../../_robot/adding-links_add-form.png
       ...  css=#content

.. .. figure:: ../../_robot/adding-links_add-form.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Adding links form
   

Fill in the **Title** field and Castle will fill in the ID and Url field based on the title you entered.  This screen also shows the state of the page, whether it is published, unpublished, or pending approval for publication. Click the **Create and Edit** button.  You will then see your page ready to be edited.

Good titles for links are important, because the titles will show up in lists of links, and because there tend to be large numbers links held in a folder or collection.



The Link Object in Use
----------------------

A link object will behave in the following ways, depending on your login
status, or permissions.

-  **If you have the ability to edit the link object**, when you click on the link object you'll be taken to the object itself so that you can edit it (otherwise you'd be taken to the link's target and could never get to the edit tab!)
-  **If you don't have the ability to edit the link object**, when you click on the link object you'll be taken to the target of the link object. Likewise, if you enter the web address of the link object
   directly in your browser, you'll be taken directly to the link's target. The link object in this case acts as a *redirect*.
