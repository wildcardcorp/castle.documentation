Adding Folders 
==============


Adding folders to a Castle web site is the basic way of controlling the organization of content.

You have undoubtedly created folders (directories) on your computer's hard drive.
Personal computers use a hierarchy of folders to structure and organize the programs and files on the hard drive.
In Castle folders are essentially used the same way, except that they are created on a Castle web site, for organizing content in Castle's built-in storage system.

Folders are added by clicking the **Add...** popup menu.
Select **Folder** from the menu:

.. .. code:: robotframework
      :class: hidden

   *** Test Cases ***

   Show add new folder menu
       Go to  ${PLONE_URL}

       Wait until element is visible
       ...  css=span.icon-plone-contentmenu-factories
       Click element  css=span.icon-plone-contentmenu-factories

       Wait until element is visible
       ...  css=#plone-contentmenu-factories li.plone-toolbar-submenu-header

       Mouse over  folder
       Update element style  portal-footer  display  none

       Capture and crop page screenshot
       ...  ${CURDIR}/../../_robot/adding-folders_add-menu.png
       ...  css=div.plone-toolbar-container
       ...  css=#plone-contentmenu-factories ul

.. .. figure:: ../../_robot/adding-folders_add-menu.png
      :align: center
      :alt: add-new-menu.png

You should now see the *Add Folder* screen:

.. image:: AddFolder.png

.. .. code:: robotframework
      :class: hidden

   *** Test Cases ***

   Show new folder add form
       Page should contain element  folder
       Click link  folder

       Wait until element is visible
       ...  css=#form-widgets-IDublinCore-title

       Capture and crop page screenshot
       ...  ${CURDIR}/../../_robot/adding-folders_add-form.png
       ...  css=#content

.. .. figure:: ../../_robot/adding-folders_add-form.png
      :align: center
      :alt:

   
Fill in the **Title** field and Castle will fill in the ID and Url field.  This screen also shows the state of the page, whether it is published, unpublished, or pending approval for publication. Click the **Create and Edit** button.  You will then see your page ready to be edited.

The **Title** will appear at the top of the page.
The **Summary** is optional; you can always come back to the edit panel if you need to add a description of the folder.
Summaries are useful when a site visitor uses the search tool included with Castle - results will display with both the Title and Summary of the item.

Click the **Properties** button and you will see the **Edit Folder** panel.
You will notice tabs along the top:

-  *Default*, for entering the Title and Description fields,
-  *Settings,* for allowing comments about the item, enabling :ref:`rst_prev-next-links`,
   and choosing whether it shows in the navigation menu for the web
   site.
-  *Categorization,* for specifying categories that apply to the folder
   (you may know these as *keywords*),
-  *Dates*, for setting the time period when the folder should be
   available for view on the web site,
-  *Ownership*, for specifying the creator and/or contributors for the
   content item,

These tabs are standard, so you'll see them when you click other content types.
We will cover these tabs in another section of this user manual.

Be sure to click **Save** in the upper right corner of the page when you are finished.
