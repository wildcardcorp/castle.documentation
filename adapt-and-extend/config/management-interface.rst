ZMI, the Zope Management Interface 
==================================

Here be dragons.

The ZMI is a direct interface into the backend software stack of Castle.
While it can still serve as a valuable tool for Plone specialists to fix problems or accomplish certain tasks, it is *not* recommended as a regular tool for Castle maintenance.

If you are just starting out, this is probably not where you want to go.

If you are a Plone expert, this is where to get to the venerable ZMI.


.. note::

   Only users with role "Manager" can use this option.
